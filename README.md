## 🚀 Introduction  
This project is a **major data analytics case study** on Zomato restaurant data.  
- 📂 **100K+ sales records** analyzed across multiple cities & cuisines  
- 🍽️ **5 relational tables** covering restaurants, menus, orders, users & food items  
- 📈 Achieved **97%+ accuracy** in KPI validation after cleaning & transformations  
- 📊 Final outputs presented as **SQL queries, Python visualizations, and Tableau dashboards**  

The project demonstrates **how raw restaurant data is transformed into actionable intelligence** for decision-making in the food-tech industry.

## 📂 Dataset  
- Source: [📌 Kaggle – Zomato Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anas123siddiqui/zomato-database)  
- Tables Used:  
  - **Food** → Item ID, name, Veg/Non-Veg classification  
  - **Menu** → Price, cuisines, restaurant linkage  
  - **Orders** → Sales, timestamps, user and restaurant mapping  
  - **Restaurant** → Location, ratings, cost, cuisines  
  - **Users** → Demographics (age, gender, income, education, family size)  

### 🔧 Data Preparation  
✔ Standardized currencies (USD → INR)  
✔ Normalized restaurant ratings & menu pricing  
✔ Cleaned inconsistent datatypes (INT → VARCHAR → FLOAT fixes)  
✔ Removed duplicates, orphan records, and missing values  

✅ Post-cleaning validation confirmed **97% consistency with original reports**.

## 🗄️ Database Schema & ERD  
Relational schema was built in **PostgreSQL** with proper constraints.

## 🔎 Workflow  
he following steps outline the end-to-end workflow for this project:

- **SQL Table Formation** : Database schema is designed and SQL tables are created based on the structure of the CSV files using appropriate data types and primary keys.

- **Data Upload (CSV Files)** : Raw datasets are imported into the respective SQL tables.

- **Data Cleaning** : Unnecessary nulls, duplicates, and inconsistencies are handled using SQL scripts to ensure data quality and integrity before analysis.

- **Foreign Key Formation** : Relationships are established between tables by defining foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity and enable relational queries.

- **SQL Queries** : Complex SQL queries are written to extract insights such as sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance across various dimensions.

- **Result Visualization ** : The query results are connected to Tableau for interactive dashboards and visualizations to effectively communicate key business insights.

## 💡 Key Questions Solved  
- Which restaurants generate the most **revenue & orders**?  
- Which **cuisines** are most popular?  
- How do **income & demographics** affect ordering behavior?  
- What are the **peak days, times, and months** for orders?  
- Who are the **top-spending customers**?  
- Which restaurants have the **most diverse menus**?

## 📊 Dashboards  
Dashboards were created using **Orders, Menu, Restaurant, and Users tables**.

</p>

Python was utilized for basic visualization of key columns. For instance, visualizations of cuisine or price groups were created using pie charts.

For additional visualizations, such as price groups, restaurants, food items, order counts, and dates, vertical bar charts were employed.

📌 **Key Findings from Dashboards**:  
- **Weekends & evenings** → highest order volume  
- **High-income customers** order more frequently & spend more per order  
- **Casual Dining & Quick Bites** dominate order volume; **Fine Dining** has highest spend per order  
- Balanced **Veg vs Non-Veg** demand across all customer groups
